Hi, I‚Äôm a husband to one, father to two, and born in the 20th century. I played the original **Zelda**, and I still think time travel is possible. My goal with this blog is to learn and become a better writer. The purpose is to provide one perspective from working on personal projects. There are no deadlines or schedules for posts so I work on what comes naturally.

Right now, I‚Äôm working on three projects:

- ‚úçÔ∏è A blog about furniture, productivity, and navigating modern tools with a retro soul  
    - Random AI projects
- üì± An app (some details coming...)  
    - Shopify API
    - Flutter
    - OTA programming
    - ESP32 micropython programming
- üõí An e-commerce site built with Shopify 
    - Shopify
    - SEO
    - Google Analytics

When I don‚Äôt know what something is, I **Google**. When I don‚Äôt know how to do something, I **ChatGPT**. I think of both as people with personalities who know and don't know things.
